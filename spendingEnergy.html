            <h2>Different Activities Contributing to Energy Expenditure</h2>
            <p>There are multiple ways through which the human body transforms and dissipates energy.  </p>
            <p>Some of them include basic bodily functions, while other include additional bodily activities such as walking, working out, etc.</p>
            <p>Most of the energy is used up by basic bodily functions, but additional activities are crucial as we can control them. They often make the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy body</p>
