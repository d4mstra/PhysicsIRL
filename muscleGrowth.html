            <h2>Calories and Muscle Growth</h2>
            <p>Caloric intake supports muscle growth by providing the necessary energy and macronutrients for the synthesis of new muscle tissue. In a state of caloric surplus, the body has enough resources to repair damaged muscle fibers which contributes to overall muscle hypertrophy. </p>
            <p>  In addition to providing energy for muscle repair and growth, caloric intake also plays a crucial role in fueling the various physiological processes involved in muscle development. </p>
            <p> Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins obtained from food serve as the building blocks for muscle tissue synthesis and repair.</p>
